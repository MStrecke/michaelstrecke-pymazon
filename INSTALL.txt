 
==Installation==
Pymazon was made to provide an alternative to the Linux version of the Amazon 
dowloader (and hopefully avoid most the issues that plague it). That said, 
it should still run just fine under Windows. 

First, make sure you have [http://www.pycrypto.org PyCrypto] installed. 
On Ubuntu:
    
{{{
$ sudo apt-get install python-crypto
}}}

or

{{{
$ pip install pycrypto
}}}

If you don't have pip installed, you can get it from the cheeseshop. 
I recommend pip over setuptools.

{{{
$ easy_install pip
}}}

If you want to use the GUI, you will need to have PyQt4 or PyGtk installed. 
On Ubuntu:
    
{{{
$ sudo apt-get install python-qt4
}}}
or
{{{
$ sudo apt-get install python-gtk2
}}}

Once you have PyCrypto (and optionally PyQt4 of PyGtk) installed, 
you can install Pymazon.

To get Pymazon from the cheeseshop:
    
{{{
$ pip install pymazon
}}}
or
{{{
$ easy_install pymazon
}}}

If you're not using virtualenv, you may need to sudo.   

Or, to build/install Pymazon yourself (there's really nothing to _build_):
    
{{{
$ wget http://pymazon.googlecode.com/files/Pymazon-0.1.1.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf Pymazon-0.1.1.tar.gz
$ cd Pymazon-0.1.1
$ sudo python setup.py install
}}}

or, if you want to install locally

{{{
$ python setup.py install --user
}}}

If you install locally, you may need to symlink ~/.local/bin/pymazon 
to a folder on your PATH

You can also download the bleeding-edge source with Mercurial:
    
{{{
$ hg clone https://pymazon.googlecode.com/hg/ pymazon 
}}}

Then just build/install it via:
    
{{{
$ python setup.py install
}}}
