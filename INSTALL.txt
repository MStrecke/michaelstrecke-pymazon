The only hard dependency is pycrypto (http://www.pycrypto.org PyCrypto), 
so you need to make sure you have that installed. On Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get install python-crypto


If you want to use the GUI, you will need to have either PyQt4 or PyGtk 
installed. On Ubuntu:    

$ sudo apt-get install python-qt4

or

$ sudo apt-get install python-gtk2


Once you have PyCrypto (and optionally PyQt4 of PyGtk) installed, 
you can install Pymazon.

To get Pymazon from the cheeseshop:
    
$ sudo easy_install pymazon

or

$ sudo pip install pymazon


Or, to build/install Pymazon yourself (there's really nothing to _build_):    

$ wget http://pymazon.googlecode.com/files/Pymazon-0.9.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf Pymazon-0.9.tar.gz
$ cd Pymazon-0.9
$ sudo python setup.py install

or, if you want to install locally

$ python setup.py install --user

If you install locally, you may need to symlink ~/.local/bin/pymazon 
to a folder on your PATH

You can also download the bleeding-edge source with Mercurial:
    
$ hg clone https://pymazon.googlecode.com/hg/ pymazon

Then just build/install it via:
    
$ sudo python setup.py install
